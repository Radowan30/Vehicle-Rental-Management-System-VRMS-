## Vehicle Rental Management System (VRMS)

# INTRODUCTION 
In today's fast-paced world, the demand for efficient and streamlined vehicle rental services is 
paramount. Traditional vehicle rental systems often rely on extensive physical records and 
manual processes, leading to various operational challenges and inefficiencies. To address 
these issues, an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach can be employed to design a 
robust and scalable Vehicle Rental Management System (VRMS), which is this project.

# Functionality
This Java program assumes the user to be the manager of a car rental business. The manager is able to add the information of new vehicles that are in the warehouse, display the warehouse details, change warehouse specifications as well as add the information of rentals and display them. The manager can add details of servicing that was done to a vehcle, and they also have the option to view vehicle information by a certain type. Lastly, when the manager exits the program, a text file is created that stores all the information they entered during their session.
